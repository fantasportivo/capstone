Dataset

In order to develop our project, we can use dataset of postal code of Canada merged with geolocalization of single neighborhoods. This project wants to define a common starting point for a generic analyisis useful for other places.
Our dataset includes 103 rows and 5 columns where for every borough and neighborhood we have the corresponding latitude and longitude.
In this way we can cluster different venues related to their position.
