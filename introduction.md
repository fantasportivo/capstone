Introduction/Business Problem

We are living in an iper-connected world where all informations are available on internet. A lot of web sites try to advice users in their choices about restaurants, places to visit and more over. We want every day and in every time to click on that sites and obtain answers to our questions. The matter is: how we can analyze great datasets in order to deliver a correct result in few seconds. To do this we have to cluster every venues, assign a rating and than we can answer to customers.
After an initial work on dataset, foursquare is useful to select venues in a corrected way, also related to distance between different places.
